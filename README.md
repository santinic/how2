# how2: stackoverflow from the terminal

how2 finds the simplest way to do something in a unix shell.
It's like `man`, but you can query it in natural language:

## Install
You can install it via npm:

`npm install -g how2`

#### If you don't have npm:
Then [just install NodeJS](https://nodejs.org):
- On Ubuntu try with ```sudo apt-get install nodejs npm```
- On Mac ```brew install node```


## Usage
If you don't specify a language **it defaults to Bash** unix command line.
how2 tries to give you immediately the most likely answer:

After that you can press SPACE to go to the interactive mode, where you can choose a different stackoverflow question/answer.

With ```-l``` you can also find answers for other languages:

```
$ how2 -l python permutations of a list
```

## How does it work ?
It uses Google and Stackoverflow APIs, because Stackoverflow search on its own doesn't
works as well.


## Why ?
Because I can never remember how to do certain things. And reading man pages always takes too long.

## TODO
* Add automatic copy/paste from -i to command line
